# Vue Projects

This is a collection of small projects that I've made to help me learn Vue. \
Deployed links (when available) and additional info can be found in each project folder.

So far it is made up of the projects:
* <i>Catan Player Randomiser</i> – a site for randomising player positioning in the board game Catan.
* <i>Choices to Make!</i> – an attempt to replicate a drag-and-drop preference arrangement prompt that I'd seen online (preference arrangement component).

Stay safe, \
Happy coding, \
Good times ahead.
