# Catan Player Randomiser
<ins>Deployed at:</ins> https://catan-randomiser.netlify.app/

This is a simple site that aims to randomise the initial setup of the of players in the board-game Catan. \
The idea is that you can choose between how many players you want to play with, and the site will randomise the player houses, following the positioning rules of the game.

I started off thinking that this would be a quick and easy project to learn Vue with, but it turns out there was some pretty tricky logic for the positioning (all houses have to be placed two 'roads' away from their neighbour). \
<i>All in good fun.</i>

Note that the <b><i>tech-stack</i></b> pretty much just uses Vue and Sass, and is deployed on Netlify.
